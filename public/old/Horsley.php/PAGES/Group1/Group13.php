<div><font color="#000099" size="5">Feedback from the consultation among Horsley parishioners</font></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><font size="3">The recent consultation across the village has demonstrated substantial interest in the future of Nupend Farm which has been a working farm in the village since the 1600s, providing important employment, food and a social hub for the village. &nbsp;</font></div><div><font size="3"><br></font></div><div><font size="3">Villagers have been keen to ensure new housing, whether at Nupend Farm or elsewhere in Horsley, is sustainable, socially, economically and environmentally.</font></div><div><font size="3"><br></font></div><div><font size="3">Five main planning issues emerged from the consultation with Horsley parishioners in relation to the Nupend site. You may want to discuss these with Hunter Page and the Farmar family at the exhibition on Thursday.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font size="3">&nbsp;</font></div><div><font size="3" color="#000099"><b>The site is outside the village settlement boundary</b></font></div><div><font size="3">Nearly three-quarters of participants in the survey strongly reject building outside Horsley’s settlement boundary. The boundary is seen as a vital safeguard to sustain the identity and autonomy of Horsley. This confirms similar findings in an earlier Village Appraisal carried out in 2000.</font></div><div><font size="3"><br></font></div><div><font size="3" color="#000099"><b>The distance of the site from the village</b></font></div><div><font size="3">This would mean new residents at the estate would drive to access the school, pub and shop, as well as major centres of employment, retail and entertainment. The increase in traffic was a concern expressed by many, not just for the Nupend hamlet. All road junctions onto the B4058 in Horsley are “blind”.</font></div><div><font size="3"><br></font></div><div><font size="3" color="#000099"><b>Scale</b></font></div><div><font size="3">The current proposal for 27 houses is disproportionate to the rest of the village. Most people in the survey agreed up to 5 houses on one plot to be appropriate and that no more than 3 additional new houses should be built within the village boundary per year over the next 5 years.</font></div><div><font size="3"><br></font></div><div><font size="3" color="#000099"><b>The site is part of Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</b></font></div><div><font size="3">The farmyard has its own distinct wildlife, flora and fauna habitats that many people wanted to sustain. It is also visible for miles around. The visual impact of a modern housing estate will be much greater than dark agricultural buildings.</font></div><div><font size="3"><br></font></div><div><font size="3" color="#000099"><b>The site has Grade II listed buildings</b></font></div><div><font size="3">These lie within its boundaries. Neighbouring houses are also listed. This gives the Nupend hamlet a strong sense of architectural and agricultural history that reflects the vernacular of Horsley village.</font></div><div><font size="3"><br></font></div><div><br></div>
