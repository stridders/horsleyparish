This included some figures split between food, drink and B &amp; B which we tried to break down into manageable numbers in the presentation. However there is more than one way of making the figures work. For example, while 320 meals in a week was perhaps an optimistic estimate based on the assumption that the place will be buzzing with trade all the time, the pub can still be viable with many less meals served. &nbsp;</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Calibri;"><font size="3"><br></font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Calibri;"><font size="3">Thus, another estimate based on quite conservative figures, e.g. 25% capacity most lunchtimes, rising to 75% on Sunday lunchtimes and 35% capacity on weekday evenings rising to 75% on Friday and Saturday evenings would still generate 208 covers in a week. Based an average spend of £13 per person we would still produce £2700 a week just on food. &nbsp;The same kind of arithmetic can be applied to drink and B &amp; B and again it suggests that the pub can be viable on much less trade than the 'best case' figures presented at the Public Meeting.</font></div></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Calibri;"><font size="3"><br></font></div><div><font size="3"><font color="#000000" face="Calibri">We've modelled a number of different income and expenditure&nbsp;scenarios (in quite ruthless detail), but would prefer not to publish these on the website (i.e. on a public forum).
