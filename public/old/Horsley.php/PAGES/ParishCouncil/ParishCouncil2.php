<font face="trebuchet ms" size="3">The 1965 Royal Commission on Local Government (The Redcliffe-Maude Commission) recommended that local			councils should be empowered to do what they pleased for the benefit of their people, and a consequence			of this was the very important 1972 Local Government Act which removed many of the restrictions on the			activities of parish councils. For example, before the 1972 Act, parish councils couldn’t save money 			from one year to the next in order to fund a major project.</font><br>

<font face="arial"><font size="2"><p><strong><font size="5"></font></strong>&nbsp;<strong><br></strong><font face="trebuchet ms" size="3">Something all councils have to do these 			days to avoid having a massive council tax for each year that anything new is attempted. Subsequent 			legislation has added to parish council powers and now local councils can undertake any of the 			following things:-<br><br></font></p></font></font><p><font face="trebuchet ms" size="3">The provision of allotments.</font></p><p><font face="trebuchet ms" size="3">Developing and improving knowledge of the arts and crafts.</font></p><p><font face="trebuchet ms" size="3">Provision of bars and launderettes.</font></p><p><font face="trebuchet ms" size="3">Cemeteries, crematoria, maintenance of churchyards and the provision of mortuaries.</font></p><p><font face="trebuchet ms" size="3">Provision and maintenance of public clocks.</font></p><p><font face="trebuchet ms" size="3">Provision of any form of public entertainment and of any premises for giving entertainments; this includes maintaining bands or orchestras and providing for dancing.</font></p><p><font face="trebuchet ms" size="3">The provision of buildings for public meetings and functions, indoor sports, physical recreation, for clubs having recreation, social or athletic objectives.</font></p><p><font face="trebuchet ms" size="3">The provision and maintenance of footway lighting, which lights roads and pavements.</font></p><p><font face="trebuchet ms" size="3">The provision of litter bins and the support of anti-litter campaigns.</font></p><p><font face="trebuchet ms" size="3">The provision and maintenance of public open spaces, pleasure grounds and public walks, public lavatories, car parks, cycle parks, public parks and associated facilities.</font></p><p><font face="trebuchet ms" size="3">Maintenance of public footpaths and bridleways, planting and maintaining road side verges.</font></p><p><font face="trebuchet ms" size="3">Maintenance of public seats, shelters for general public use and particularly for bus passengers, erection of signs which warn of dangers, renounce a place name or indicate a bus stop.</font></p><p><font face="trebuchet ms" size="3">Provision of indoor or outdoor swimming pools or bathing places.</font></p><p><font face="trebuchet ms" size="3">Provision of facilities for conferences, the encouragement of recreation and business tourism.</font></p><p><font face="trebuchet ms" size="3">Powers to maintain a village or town green.</font></p><br><font face="trebuchet ms" size="3">            In addition to all those things, a parish council can do anything,             provided it is for the general benefit of the community, and that             the expenditure in any one year does not exceed £5.30 per local government             elector in that particular parish or community. But indeed, most things             that the parish council might wish to do or hope to do could be covered             by other legislation for which expenditure is unlimited. The only             limit being imposed is that of the reluctance of parishioners to pay. <br></font>
