A house at Horsley was licensed by protestant dissenters in 1735 and another by Baptists in 1756.   A chapel was built for Wesleyans at Downend in 1820 and licensed in 1822. In 1851 the congregation at the chapel numbered <i>c</i>. 200. The chapel is not recorded in use after 1919   and in 1972 the site was occupied by garages to a private house. Protestant dissenters licensed houses at Nupend in 1818 and 1828.  A small chapel was erected at the southern end of Rockness near the boundary with Nailsworth in the earlier 20th century but no record of its use has been found.</font><br></p>
