Sessions are planned and structured to give a full and varied range of activities. A full curriculum and planning details are always available. The curriculum is fully compatible with the "Foundation Stage", which is the stage of development that continues until the end of the school reception year and is required by the Nursery Education Grant Scheme.</font></p><p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p><p><font size="3">The Playgroup has received highly favourable Ofsted reports.
