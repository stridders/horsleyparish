    <div>
        A parish council is a local authority that makes decisions on behalf of the people in the parish.
        It is the level government closest to the community, with the district authority (<a href="http://www2.stroud.gov.uk/cmislive_public/ParishCouncils.aspx">
        Stroud District Council</a>) above it in the hierarchy.

        If you’ve never been to a parish council meeting before, you may be forgiven for thinking that
        your parish councillors are just a group of (probably older) people who meet now and then in the village
        village hall to discuss matters that rarely concern you. If however.... <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>You've been involved in any planning applications inside the Parish</li>
            <li>You've volunteered at the community shop</li>
            <li>You helped to raise money for (and/or help build) the pavilion</li>
            <li>You've used the playing fields</li>
            <li>You've hired the village hall</li>
            <li>You've followed the development and re-opening of The Hog (formerly the Bell & Castle) pub</li>
        </ul>
        ....then you’ll know that the PC has an important role to play within the community.

        <h4>Why become a Parish Councillor?</h4>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="text-content flex-container flex-container-row flex-cols">
    <div>
        By becoming a parish councillor you become someone your community will look to for help, guidance
        and support. A community leader with the power to influence decisions for the benefit of the people
        you serve.  Seeing your community change for the better, as a result of decisions you have helped
        make, is something that can give you a sense of achievement and pride.<br>
        If you feel under-represented in local government, or that decision are being made outside of your
        control, or perhaps you just want to affect changes or give something back to the community, then
        joining the Parish Council is an excellent way to get involved.

        <h4>What decisions do Parish Councils make?</h4>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="text-content flex-container flex-container-row flex-cols">
    <div>
        Parish councils make all kinds of decisions on issues that affect the local community.  Probably the
        most common topics that parish councils get involved with are planning matters (they are statutory
        consultees), crime prevention, managing open spaces and campaigning for and delivering better
        services and facilities.
        <br><br>
        It’s true to say that on their own, parish councils have limited powers to make decisions.  But they
        do have the ability to negotiate with, and the power to influence, those other organisations that
        do make the final decisions (such as the borough council, health authorities, police etc).
        <br><br>
        In this respect parish councils are extremely powerful.  The organisations that make the final
        decisions know that a parish council gives the best reflection of how a community feels about something,
        and its views will be taken seriously.
        <br><br>
        We have a fantastically active and vibrant community, so in many cases the role of the PC has
        been to help bring people together. It is groups of local volunteers who often
        go on to achieve the most, but the PC is always available for help, support and guidance.

        The PC meet 12 times a year, usually on the 4th Tuesday of each month, and members of the public are
        welcome to attend. Meetings typically last two to three hours, depending on the scope fo the agenda.
        Some councillors may be asked to represent the parish council at other community meetings or events,
        or to follow up on specific action items (raised during a meeting) but these won’t take up a great
        deal of your time.

        They have a wide range of powers which essentially related to local matters, such as looking
        after community buildings, open space, allotments, play areas, street lighting, bus shelters,
        car parks and much more.  The council also has the power to raise money through taxation,
        the precept.  The precept is the parish council’s share of the council tax.  The precept demand
        goes to the billing authority, the district council, which collects the tax for the parish council.

        The duties and functions of the parish council are many and varied. They meet monthly and consider
        planning applications and any other matters referred to it by local residents, Stroud DC and
        by central government.  All meetings are open to the public and there is a forum before the start
        of the meeting at which members of the public can raise concerns and ask questions.  There is also
        an annual meeting which all parishioners are invited to attend.  All meetings are advertised on the
        council notice boards.  Residents can bring to the attention of the parish council anything that
        concerns them, either directly or though the clerk.  If matters raised are not the responsibility
        of the council, the clerk can bring them to the attention of the proper authority.

        Don’t take our word for it!

        The best way to find out what it’s like to be a parish councillor is to talk to someone who’s
        doing it now.  Come along to a parish council meeting, or speak to one of our councillors and find
        out what they think of the job.
