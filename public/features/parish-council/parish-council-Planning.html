        <h3>Horsley Parish Council Position re Barton End Equestrian Application S.17/051/CPE</h3>
        <br>
        A planning application for a ‘Certificate of lawful existing use’ has been submitted to Stroud District Council
        on behalf of the Barton end Equestrian Centre.
        The centre was originally granted planning permission (in 2001) with a restriction for no more than 12 horses.
        It has subsequently grown considerably and has been in breach of planning for many years.<br><br>
        Stroud District Council has failed in its duty to enforcement these restrictions (as detailed in the planning
        chronology attached below), which has been a cause for concern for some local residents. The fact that the land
        owner, Mr Rolland Blackwell, has been an SDC district councillor and has sat on the Development Control
        Committee has further clouded this issue. <br>
        <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>The Parish Council have no wish to see this local business close. They simply wish to see it placed on
                a proper regulated footing</li>
            <li>The current application should not be granted for the reasons set out in our response to Stroud
                District Council on S.17/051/CPE . This would leave two options available to the Council - to enforce
                against the existing usage and buildings which have no consent, or to require the applicant to lodge a
                comprehensive planning application on the entire site.</li>
            <li>To allow unrestricted numbers of horses is open to abuse</li>
            <li>Local residents should have the ability to submit facts they know and comment as to the authenticity of
                these submitted. This has now been agreed by SDC after initial refusal ,but there is little time to
                inform residents and get the information to SDC</li>
            <li>This application should be reviewed not in private by officers but in a public meeting of the
                Development Control Committee, (not least because of the fact the land owner sat on the DCC )</li>
            <li>There needs to be some way of addressing the highways issues around the site as the have been a
                significant number of accidents on the A46 at a dangerous junction on the lane leading to this site,
                and congestion on the lanes around it.</li>
            <li>StroudDistrictCouncilmustcarryoutanindependentinvestigationastoitslackof consistent enforcement of
                planning rules and whether the landowner’s status as a District Councillor and member of DCC was
                addressed in a proper manner.</li>
