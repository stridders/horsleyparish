            school, a pub, a village hall, a pavilion (which houses the community shop) and a playing field and play
            area.

            <h3>A Rich History</h3>
            The settlement of Horsley can be dated back to 1066, when lands were granted to Troarn Abbey (Calvados, France).
            At this time it consisted (amongst other things) of a Mill, 6 plough lands, a prior, a monk, a chaplain
            (the three of whom founded 'Horsley Priory') and a knight (on horseback). You can read about the parish's history

            <h3>An Active Rural Community</h3>
            Horsley has a diverse, vibrant and thriving community, which is evident from the many volunteer-lead
            projects that have been successfully completed over the years. e.g.:<br><br>

            <p>This was a community initiative to improve the children's playground, which was minimalist in design,
                occasionally flooded and 80% broken. Thanks to a grant from the Landfill Communities Fund, we were able
                to build this fantastic, landscaped play area that now draws families from all over the area.

            <p>This was a community initiative to refurbish St. Martin's church so that it could become a multi-use
                premises, to be used by the school during the week (as a main hall), as a venue for both public
                and private events, and to host the full range of church services.

            <p>When the local shop was due to close (<i>fyi: the shop-keeping couple wanted to retire and needed
                their front room back</i>), Horsley rallied to form a new co-operative
                community shop, staffed by volunteers and housed in a parish-owned pavilion building (<i>btw: this was
                another community project, managed by the parish council and built mainly by local volunteers</i>).

            <p>The first release of Horsley's Local Neighbourhood Plan has just been published (September 2018), and is now
                open for public consultation. This is an accumulation of years of work by many volunteers, with a disparate
                range of skills and experience. It's a co-ordinated effort on behalf of the community to influence
                future development in this amazing area of outstanding natural beauty (AONB).
