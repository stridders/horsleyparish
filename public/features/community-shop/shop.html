            The Horsley Community Shop is reviving the Horsley village email. Whoop whoop, we hear
            you say... because the village emails were very popular and people found them extremely
            useful. Your shop will send emails on your behalf with your requests to give away items,
            ask for recommendations and inform about upcoming village events. If you would like to
            send a message to the community, please email
            <a href="mailto:comms@horsleyshop.co.uk">comms@horsleyshop.co.uk</a>.
            The emails may also include news from the shop.
