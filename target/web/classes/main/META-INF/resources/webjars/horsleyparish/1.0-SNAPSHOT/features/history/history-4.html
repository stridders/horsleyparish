        The account of manorial government and parochial administration given here includes information
        for that part of the parish subsequently transferred to Nailsworth. Manor courts were held by the
        lord of the manor during the Middle Ages.  Cirencester Abbey, which had been excluded from exercising
        view of frankpledge in the manor for 40 years, agreed with the lord of the manor <i>c</i>. 1255 that
        its bailiffs should hold the view there twice a year and the lord should take the profits at a yearly
        rent of 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.  Nevertheless the two parties were in dispute in 1261 over the method
        of appointing a tithingman for Horsley and it was agreed that the office should be filled in the manor
        court but before the abbey's bailiffs.  In 1332 courts were held four times a year,  and manor courts
        and views of frankpledge were held twice yearly in the early 16th century when two tithings, Barton End
        and Nupend, were represented.

        An estate at Horsley was said to have fallen to the lord of the manor by forfeiture through felony but
        no record of any warrant granting such a right to the lord has been found.  In 1630 by-laws were agreed
        for the manor, which sought to fine persons responsible for introducing paupers to the parish, and the
        manor court elected two haywards to regulate the commons.   The court was recorded in the earlier 18th
        century   but had apparently fallen into disuse by 1793 when it was revived.  From that date courts
        leet and baron were held which elected tithingmen for Barton End, Nailsworth, and Downend, and a
        constable and a hayward.  The court, which usually met at the Boot inn,  dealt mainly with encroachments
        on the lord's waste but from 1815 only the election of officers is recorded.
