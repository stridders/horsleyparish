        Before the 19th century nonconformity within the parish of Horsley was based on meeting-houses in
        the settlements later transferred to Nailsworth, and so statistics for early nonconformity at
        Horsley are given under Nailsworth. A house at Horsley was licensed by protestant dissenters in
        1735 and another by Baptists in 1756.   A chapel was built for Wesleyans at Downend in 1820 and
        licensed in 1822. In 1851 the congregation at the chapel numbered <i>c</i>. 200. The chapel is
        not recorded in use after 1919   and in 1972 the site was occupied by garages to a private house.
        Protestant dissenters licensed houses at Nupend in 1818 and 1828.  A small chapel was erected at
        the southern end of Rockness near the boundary with Nailsworth in the earlier 20th century but no
        record of its use has been found.
