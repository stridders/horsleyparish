            The Neighbourhood Plan has been commissioned by Horsley Parish Council. It will define
            development proposals for the village and the 16 surrounding hamlets for the next 20 years.
                This includes: housing; employment; landscape; and the environment. </p>
            <p>It is currently in draft format and is available to view on this website (click the link botton below).

                The Parish Council is keen to share the proposals and hear views about them from those who
                live and work in Horsley Parish (Gloucestershire). They encourage residents to subscribe
                to the newsletter (see form on the right), although every effort will be made to include
                people who are not on email.
