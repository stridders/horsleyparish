                    It defines development proposals for the village and the 16 surrounding hamlets for the next
                    20 years. A 6-week consultation period now begins.</b>

                The Parish Council is keen to share the proposals and hear views about them from those who
                live and work in Horsley Parish (Gloucestershire). They encourage residents to subscribe
                to the newsletter (see form on the right), although every effort will be made to include
                people who are not on email.
