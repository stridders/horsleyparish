    The following article was written by Mr A.T. Kent in 1984 for the Parish magazine, which
    makes for interesting reading.
    <br>    <br>


    In the year 1921, after the 1914-18 war when we were all demobbed and there was no work to be had, a
    meeting of ex-service men was held in the School (as that was the only place to hold a meeting in
    those days).  The meeting was called by Mr. Ambrose Smith of Downend, who informed us that the N.A.C.B
    had a surplus of profits which they wished to allocate to organisations of ex-service men (so much per
    head for men who had survived the war).
    <br>    <br>
    It was decided that we should start an ex-service men’s club and Mr. Smith was elected as Secretary
    and was to make an application for a grant on behalf of the men of this Parish. The application was
    granted, so we then had to decide what to do with it. A committee was subsequently elected.
    <br>    <br>
    There was a hut advertised for sale at Cirencester and it was decided to make an offer for it using
    the grant (from N.A.C.B) and a supplement from Major F.Ramsden (who was residing at the Priory at
    the time.). The next thing was getting the hut here and finding somewhere to site it.
    <br>    <br>
    The ground for the site was given to us by Col. John Lowsley Williams of Chevange, who was Lord of
    the Manor of Horsley. We then got Mr. H. Brinkworth (a carpenter from Nailsworth) to take on the
    task of dismantling the hut in sections. As we were still out of work we were taken out on a lorry
    by Mr. Newman of Nailsworth and within three days we had it transported to Horsley. The sleepers to
    put it on were given to us by the Midland Railway and under the direction of Mr. Brinkworth we erected
    the hut. All the work was done voluntarily.
    <br>    <br>
    We then started an ex-service men’s club and things went along O.K., although we found that it was
    not quite big enough so we added an extra 15 feet, which made a lot of difference and helped it along.
    <br>    <br>
    In 1933 a special meeting was called and the decision was made to run a branch of the British Legion.
    Col. L. Partridge was elected President, Mr. C. Light was elected Chairman, Mr. V. Heaven elected
    Secretary and I was elected Treasurer. Our Standard was presented to us by Sir Percival Marling V.C.
    <br>    <br>
    In 1936 we won the Union Jack in a competition organised by Sir Frances Featherstone Godley, who was
    National Chairman of the British legion. It was the 2nd prize in a world-wide competition (the 1st
    prize for which was won by a branch in Kenya). I had to go to Birmingham to receive the prize on
    behalf of the Horsley Branch. We won several certificates of merit and also the Peulaw Cup of the
    South West area province.
    <br>    <br>
    We had a fair membership of over 200. Then in 1939 came the declaration of the 2nd World War and
    we had quite a lot to do with one thing and another.
    <br>    <br>
    In 1944 we started a Welcome Home fund under the Chairmanship of Mr. F. Stevens of the Fisheries.
    Every-one in the Parish helped to raise money and by the end of 1945 we had raised the sum of £500
    (a big help in those days). In the end we donated a total of £535, which was a very good effort in
    such a short time.
    <br>    <br>
    Then the younger members wanted a club where they could have a drink as well as play games. We made
    enquiries but due to lack of space for parking and sanitation we were not allowed to alter the hut
    in any way. The only alternative was to purchase or build a Village Hall.
    <br>    <br>
    Under the Chairmanship of Mr. Stevens and the British Legion Committee we started another Building
    Fund. By 1956 we had managed to raise about £800, but then nothing further happened until 1960.
    <br>    <br>
    We had a calf given to us by Mr. Cox and Mr. Butler MP (who was residing at the Court at the time)
    as a prize for a draw at a pony show held in one of Mr. Cox’s fields. Mrs. Morley organised a dog
    show and with the help of all the people of the village we had raised the sum of £2000 by 1965.
    We made an application and received a grant from the Ministry of Education and Science of £1675
    and one from Glos. County Council of £693.
    <br>    <br>
    We considered several plans for the Hall, but were obviously restricted by our budget. Once a plan
    was agreed we obtained a quote of £5,000 to build the Hall from a Stroud-based builder (Mr. F. Hoxton).
    This we accepted and after it was built it had to be furnished with 100 chairs, 20 tables, curtains,
    crockery, cookers for the kitchen, all of which had to be paid for.
    <br>    <br>
    We opened the Hall in 1966, 21 years after we started to get the money. Mr. Stevens did not live to
    see it opened. The opening was carried out by Mr. W.T.B. Cox who was Chairman at the time and also a
    trustee.
    <br>    <br>
    During the period of getting the money for the Hall the Branch of the British Legion closed down,
    but it was the majority of the old committee who still carried on and saw the job through, so that
    the people of Horsley had a Hall of their own.
